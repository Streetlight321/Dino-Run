# Dino-Run
Trying to learn PyGame for the first time! This first project will be of "Dino Run." A simple game among children and teenagers with no WiFi.
At the moment, the code is very spaghetti. I have no idea what i'm doing so for the time being, It is spaghetti.
Expect this repo to change as time goes on and change my code to work better and be more similar to Dino Run.
